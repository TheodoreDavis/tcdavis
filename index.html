                            <p>This project was my first real programming project. The purpose of this project was to detect figurines with different colored bases and display them on a map. When we started, we didn't know how to code in java: we had just finished learning C and were learning it at the time. We split our project into smaller problems. I was in charge of parsing the images to find a section of pixels that were the same color as the base of our figurines. Then after finding the colors in the picture, I used weighted distances and trigonometry to get x and y coordinates of the figurine.</p>

                            <p>I worked on this project for one of my computer science classes. I worked on the backend with a partner. We decided to use SpringBoot to run our server since it was the platform we would be able to get the most help with, and we had no prior knowledge of coding for backend. Separately, we learned how to create databases and query them. For this project, we were using MySQL since our data was very interconnected. We then recombined and put together a simple username and password database. We knew we needed WebSockets in our project, so I nominated myself to work on that. My partner and I worked closely with the frontend to see what data they needed when an event happened. For WebSockets, we came up with codes that, when parsed, told the app or the server, which event or error was occurring. During this project, I had to practice a lot of patience while debugging. We had easy fixes like the database needing our time zone to our test cases failing because they couldn't use the ports properly (which took four days of talking to our TAs and googling). I learned how important it is to work regularly and keep in touch with your team on these types of projects.</p>

                            <p>This was a project for the 2019 ISU Fall Hackathon. Before the competition, I went to an information session and partnered up with two guys I've never talked to before. This was my first project using python. I spent the first couple of hours learning the syntax of the language. Afterward, I worked on the algorithm that decides on what workout a person. Their previous workouts would be stored so that the same muscle groups wouldn't keep getting selected. The last part of the project I worked on was the HTML and CSS for the website. This project was a great learning experience since I got to learn a new language and made friends with people I've never worked with before.</p>

                            <p>For this project I reached out to the Chem-E-Car team, who wanted an electrical engineer to redesign their circuit. They needed two circuits: one to detect light from a chemical reaction, and another to detect the absence of light due to a chemical reaction. I was able to successfully prototype the circuits and test their functionality with the team. However, due to COVID-19 I was unable to create the final products that would end up on the cars.</p><br>

                            <p>My name is Theodore Davis. Welcome to my website! It's currently in the early stages and I plan to keep improving it! I went to a small highschool where we didn't have any coding classes or clubs until my sophomore year. I ended up getting dragged into a coding competion since I was one of the computer nerds at my school. The only experience I had at the time was editing some files here and there but never writing anything from scratch. During the competion we had to do just that and I really enjoyed it. Other than computer related activities some of my interests are archery, reading, and playing dnd.</p>

                            <p>When making this website I originally planed on diving everything into different html files but I decided that would be too boring. I decided to challenge myself and make this slightly interactive... So I added buttons! I still want to play around with the formatting and try to change things up from blocks of text. If your interested here's an early version of this page before I found a template I liked <a href="old.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
